Implementations of the ChaCha20 + Poly1305 and XChaCha20 + Poly1305
AEAD constructions with a goal of simplicity and correctness rather
than performance.

## About

This code provides a portable C reference implementation of two
AEAD constructions built on top of the ChaCha20 reference
implementation from [SUPERCOP](https://bench.cr.yp.to/supercop.html)
and [Poly1305-donna](https://github.com/floodyberry/poly1305-donna).

One construction is XChaCha20 + Poly1305 in a style similar to
[NaCl](https://nacl.cr.yp.to/)'s `crypto_secretbox_xsalsa20poly1305`
but using XChaCha20 instead of XSalsa20.

The other construction is ChaCha20 + Poly1305 as specified in
[RFC 7539](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7539).
